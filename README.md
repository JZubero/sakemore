Sake More
=========

A command line tool for interfacing with Silverstripe.

This tool provides a developer or system administrator with Silverstripe functionality from the command-line.
The system can be easily extended but out of the box you get the following functionality:

 * A PHP console with Silverstripe fully loaded - You can even query the database directly with Silverstripe commands - eg var_dump(Page::get_one('Page'));
 * Command line access to the database your site is using, no need to remember the password or other details.
 * The ability to clear your caches. This includes image caches, theme templates, language files, manifest and aggregated CSS/JS.
 * Changing any users password - forgotten your password? Easily change it
 * Database dumps - This can be combined with a cron job to do regular database dumps. Pipe the output of this command into a file or similar.
